# neural-style
Implementation using TensorFlow of [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v2.pdf) by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethge. This API will mirror the Torch implementation by [Justin Johnson](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style).

On a side note, this implementation is mostly for me to become more familiar with TensorFlow's API and to get a deeper understanding of the awesome work of neural style. To summarize, neural style uses Convolutional Neural Network to combine the content of an image with the style of another image, generating a "new" hybrid image. For example...
